# Writing on the wall

Step by step, the technology integrates deeper into our lives. It gets more complex, and the further we go, the less control we have over it, and consequently - over our lives. Technology, such as our smartphones, computers, cars, even fridges, is created by corporations and is affected by their agendas. We stop owning things and instead renting them involuntarily. We don't know how to fix our electronics, we don't know how to extend it with new functions, we don't know what it's doing exactly. All cutting edge technology is proprietary...

How many times do we need to be reminded of Intel's [Management Engine](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it) that can access everything remotely on our turned-off PCs without any consent? How many [vulnerabilities](https://twitter.com/h0t_max/status/928269320064450560) does it take to be discovered? Same goes for smartphones with their independent [baseband processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor). How can we rely on technolgy serving us if it's riddled with intentional backdoors, and not exposing to us the specifics of how it operates?

Every day, giant corporations are looking for more ways to screw up us, their customers. They want more than just money, they need our constant attention, they need all the details of how we live and why. This is not about evil intentions of specific individuals, this is a systematic problem. It's written on the wall, we just need to distract from our everyday consumption in order to notice it. Let's leave the bigger problem analysis for later and focus on what we can do right now to get back the control of our devices and lives.

The only way to protect ourselves from digital exploitation is to have full source information of the products. Have an ability, even if theoretical for most, to rebuild the devices from source, to inspect it and deeply understand how it operates. Free Software Foundation was created to organize this movement by Richard Stallman. Things are not going to get better any time soon unless we take action. There needs to be a revolution in how consumer-producer relations are formed with regards to complex technology products. We need openness, transparency, and mutual respect with technology providers, we need to be conscious.

## What can be done now
  - get familiar with the [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) and how it's different from open source, consider becoming an [FSF member](https://my.fsf.org/join)
  - switch to open source software, for example by installing a Linux-based distribution and switching to LibreOffice for document workflows
  - buy hardware with open-source drivers (including CoreBoot/LibreBoot support), consider Librem [line of products](https://puri.sm/products/), especially the upcoming smartphone
  - as a developer, take another look at GPL, in light of Minix3 [being used](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/intel/) against us
  - talk to other people, discuss these issues, and bring awareness of the bigger picture
